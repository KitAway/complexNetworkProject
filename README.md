# Complex Network Course Project
The first problem is to analyze some networks and some character distributions in order to understand the behaviour of different types of networks.
The program is written in Python and pakage 'Networkx' is implemented for the network analysis.

## Usage 

> pNetwork.py   -p   Path   [-d]

>      path:   path to edge list file

>      -d:     indicate the graph is directed.

A project folder is created in the save location as the edge list file. The distribution of degree, clustring coefficients, closeness and betweenness are saved as histogram figure in project folder.
